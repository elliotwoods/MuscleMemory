# Introduction

An open source 'industrial servo motor' which employs Reinforcement Learning to train itself how best to drive a load. The user can decide in this case what is meant by 'best', e.g. speed, accuracy or energy efficiency. The model is run locally on a low cost microcontroller (i.e. ESP32), but is trained remotely where more computational resources are available (e.g. in the cloud).

## Prior work

Muscle Memory builds on the work of previous projects, most notably (Mechaduino)[https://github.com/jcchurch13/Mechaduino-Firmware] by Tropical Labs.
